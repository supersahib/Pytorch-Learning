# Pytorch-Learning

These are various Jupyter notebooks I've worked on while learning Pytorch. Will update these README as i add more


00 - Covers Pytorch Fundamentals:
  1) Intro to Tensors
     a) Random Tensors
     b) Zeros and ones
     c) Creating range of tensors and tensors-like
     d) Tensor datatypes
     e) Manipulating Tensors (Tensor Operations)
     f) Matrix Multiplication
     g) Tensor Aggregation - Min, Max, Mean, Sum
     h) Positional min & max
     i) Reshaping, Stacking, Squeezing, & Unsqeezing 
  3) Indexing
  4) Pytorch Tensors and numPy
  5) Reproducibility
